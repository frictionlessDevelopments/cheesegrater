What is not working?
- Sleep

Sleep only works when no USB devices are plugged in.

## Others

### USB

All USB Ports are mapped and corrected.
I removed `ITE Device (8595)` as it was preventing the system from correctly sleeping.

### Boot Args

Without `npci=0x2000`, the screen capture tool (Shift + ctrl + âŒ˜ + 3) behaves very erratically
